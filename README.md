 Nothing that fancy yet but not noobie either...
 
 This time, I have tried a new CSS-framework called 'Bulma' and some javascript
  
 It sets a TO WIN Score to 3 at default, you can change that ofcourse.
 When the scores are increased and scores are equal to the TO WIN Score, it ceases to increase the score and winning player score is turned GREEN and the other is turned RED.
